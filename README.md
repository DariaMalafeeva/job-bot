# Job Parser Bot

A personal Telegram bot for automating job search.

This tool helps fetch job postings by keyword and location, stores them in a local database, and sends updates via Telegram.  
Originally created to simplify my own job search and explore data parsing, automation, and simple tracking workflows in Python.

## Features

- Keyword-based job search
- HTML parsing of job listings
- Local storage using SQLite
- Telegram integration for daily alerts
- Configurable search terms and limits

## Tech Stack

- Telegram Bot API

## Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a personal project created for learning and automation purposes.  
Not intended for public deployment or commercial use. Please respect LinkedIn's Terms of Service.

## Possible Next Steps

- Add pandas-based analysis for job trends
- Store metadata for position types and locations
- Explore visual summaries via matplotlib / seaborn
